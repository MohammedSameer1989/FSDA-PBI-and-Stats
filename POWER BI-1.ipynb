    "Ans-Descriptive analytics is a branch of analytics that focuses on summarizing and describing historical data to gain insights into past trends, patterns, and relationships. Its primary objective is to provide a clear and concise understanding of what has happened in the past, without attempting to explain why it happened or predict future outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive analytics involves analyzing data using various statistical and visualization techniques to generate meaningful summaries and visual representations of the data. Some common techniques and methods used in descriptive analytics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary Statistics: Descriptive analytics often starts with calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, and percentiles to describe the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data distribution.\n",
    "Data Visualization: Visualization techniques such as histograms, bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and heatmaps are used to visually represent the data and identify patterns, trends, and outliers. Visualizations make it easier to understand complex data and communicate insights effectively.\n",
    "Frequency Analysis: Frequency analysis involves counting the occurrences of different values or categories within a dataset to understand their distribution and relative proportions. This helps in identifying the most common values or categories and detecting any unusual patterns.\n",
    "Cross-Tabulation and Pivot Tables: Cross-tabulation (also known as contingency tables) and pivot tables are used to analyze relationships between two or more categorical variables by summarizing data in a tabular format. This helps in identifying associations, correlations, and dependencies between variables.\n",
    "Time Series Analysis: Time series analysis involves analyzing data collected over time to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and cyclical variations. Time series plots, trend lines, and seasonal decomposition techniques are commonly used in descriptive analytics to analyze time-series data.\n",
    "Geospatial Analysis: Geospatial analysis involves analyzing data that has a spatial component (e.g., latitude and longitude) to identify spatial patterns, clusters, and relationships. Maps, spatial heatmaps, and spatial clustering techniques are used to visualize and analyze geospatial data.\n",
    "Overall, descriptive analytics provides valuable insights into historical data, enabling organizations to understand past performance, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions based on evidence and facts. While descriptive analytics alone may not provide insights into causality or predict future outcomes, it serves as a foundation for more advanced forms of analytics such as diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics."
